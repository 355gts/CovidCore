1. have you got the RABBIT_CONFIG_FILE environment variable set to the path and name of your rabbitmq.conf

2. Open Rabbit & view the node that is running my url is - https://localhost:15671/#/nodes/rabbit%40ISVPNKLT0000082
Confirm that against Config file you have both the default Advanced.config & rabbitmq.conf

3. Is the format of your Rabbitmq.conf correct?  I'm running version 3.8.3 of Rabbit.  In one of the prior versions they added a json format for the config file.  Also depending on the format the config file name needs to be different

old format = rabbitmq.config
new format = rabbitmq.conf

I've also put my running rabbitmq.conf file in the folder for you to cross check with.

4. Can you double check the URI that is set for the UserService.  I'm pretty sure I got the peer certificate issue because I'd changed to the amqps protocol but not updated the port from 5672 to 5671.

Dont know if you can use them but I've put my full self signed certs in the folder too, the Password for the certs is Password1.
